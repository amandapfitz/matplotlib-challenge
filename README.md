Given data from a pharmaceutical company that did an animal study on multiple drugs that treat cancerous tumors. I summarized the findings of four of the drugs used in the study and highlighted their results in graphs included below.

A scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.

A scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.

A scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate).

A bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
